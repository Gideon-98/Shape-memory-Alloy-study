# Shape-Memory-Alloy-study

The purpose of this internship project is the use of Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) materials in the reconstruction of an existing mass system on the track. The use of these materials allows us to take advantage of the characteristics of Smart Materials in such a way that the final system is much more compact and controllable. The second point in particular, as the original system had a strong spatial component that was very cumbersome. This allowed for high precision control, but with little versatility or portability if the system needed to be relocated.

SMA possess a series of properties not present in other classes of materials, which allows for their use in specific application areas, simplifying the system under examination.

In the mechatronic field, they are increasingly being used because of their chemico-physical properties that can be altered in a pseudo-controlled manner when subjected to external stress. Through simple and direct control, an SMA could replace modern actuators, reducing complexity in terms of wiring and workspace.

Through special heat treatments, it is possible to imprint an initial geometric shape onto the SMA material, which, once deformed, is capable of regaining its shape if subjected to thermal stress without showing plasticization.

This capability allows for actuation as the SMA uses the energy from the material's heating to create work that enables it to return to its original shape, which can be used by our system for movement.

In this treatise, there is a division into two topics concerning the aspects of the treated system.

The first chapter will describe the properties of Shape Memory Alloy, conducting a theoretical and practical study of the observable behaviors in our project.

Subsequently, the work done will be analyzed in order to have optimal management of the SMA actuators, also covering topics on the design of the microcontroller and power circuit used. Additionally, the implementation of circuit elements that allow for feedback analysis and control on the actuators managed by the microcontroller already in use will be described.

In this way, significant controllability is introduced into the system, despite the greater compactness and versatility provided by the SMA actuation compared to the original system.
